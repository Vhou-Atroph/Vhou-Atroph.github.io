    <center><h1>Who is Vhou?</h1></center>
    <p>Hey, I'm Vhou-Atroph! Feel free to just call me Vhou, (pronounced: voo) though.</p>
    <p>I do stuff. A lot of stuff. Some might say too much stuff. But, I enjoy the stuff I do so regardless of how much it may be, I continue to do it. Among this stuff includes programming, making videos, streaming, and writing. I also try to make art sometimes, but I do not consider myself particularly proficient at it. Because of how much stuff I do, I have become very good at finding software that works according to my needs. I have recommended much of these to my friends, and often enjoy hearing about the horrors they encounter while using them.</p>
    <p>In regards to programming, my preferred languages are Rust and Python. I have created a couple programs, such as the <a href="https://github.com/Vhou-Atroph/TT-Damage-Calculator">Toontown Damage Calculator</a> using them together. Since I learned programming primarily through reading books and watching videos, it's been a rough journey. I've learned a lot over time, and I always enjoy learning more!</p>
    <p>I took Audio/Video courses throughout high school, and was able to receive certification for Digital Video in Adobe Premiere Pro as a result of it. I even went to university for A/V, but sadly was kicked out because I could not afford to continue taking classes. I do occasionally upload to my Youtube channel, however these videos will generally be low-effort highlights from streams on my Twitch channel.</p>
    <p>I've been writing since I was 10- it's always been one of my greatest passions in life. I still don't think I'm fantastic, but I'd like to imagine that I'm alright at it. Among the first things I wrote were Toontown fanfictions. Despite how embarassing it may sound, I really am glad I wrote those stories- they allowed me to express myself creatively, and I learned that I really like writing.</p>
