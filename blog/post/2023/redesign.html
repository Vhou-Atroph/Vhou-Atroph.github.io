        <p>Hello World, once again! The Vhou-Atroph site has received a bit of a redesign. As I am not a web designer, it is very likely not the prettiest site you will look at. But it is purple and purple is my favorite color, so it makes me happy. :)</p>
        <p>Though the site was barren before, (and kind of still is!) I still had to do some cleaning up. The most important thing here is that the programs API is no longer active. Yes, this existed. It was used as a master file to verify the latest version of every program I made. However, it was a bit of a mess and difficult to use, so it has been removed. I should also add in here that there is a posts API found at <a href="https://vhou-atroph.github.com/api/posts.json">https://vhou-atroph.github.com/api/posts.json</a> that holds every blog post on the site. Maybe that'll see some use eventually!</p>
        <p>For fans of learning about other people, I have actually added information about me on the about page. Very cool! Also, I decided to replace what were previously plain text links with images instead. It looks nicer, at least in my opinion. Sorry if it doesn't I guess.</p>
        <p>Since it's important to have information about what I have made in a readily available place, there's a section on the home page for my various projects now. Not every project I make is going to go there- just the really cool important ones. This might move somewhere else some day if I ever do anything hugely important with the homepage. My only fear is having to also update all the navbars if this does happen.</p>
        <p>So uh, that's all for now. I'll probably make another blog post eventually. If I didn't it'd be really funny to have this slight redesign be the last change to the website, but I'm fairly confident another blog post will exist here eventually.</p>
